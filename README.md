# Sudoku
This is one of my first Java projects.
This software input is a Sudoku borad (as matrix), and return a solved board if it's possible, and error message otherwise.
On this project i paracticed usage of 2D and 3D matrixes, and iterating them, not ×žecessarily in the most efficiant way, but in a way that gets the right answer.

Hope you guys will enjoy looking at it :)
